# Clean, Modular Code: Part 1

Below is some code that processes cross-ref citation data for JOSS publications. The data were pulled directly from the cross-ref API but then modified to support this workshop.

## Your goal 
Your goal  is to take the code below and turn it into a script that has the following characteristics:

* The code uses clean, expressive naming conventions
* the code follows the PEP 8 style guide
* The code uses expressive names wherever possible
* The code is DRY - elements in it aren't repeated.
* The code uses principles of modularity.


### If you want to use an LLM to support your learning 

These cleanup steps are all things that a LLn LLM can support you in doing. But remember that if you are using LLMs, they likely will not always give you the right answerâ€”especially on the first, second, even sometimes the third try. 

If you are using an LLM, 

* provide it with descriptive, leading prompts that allow it to better perform the task.
* Be sure to closely check it's work -

The data used in this part of the workshop hasn't been modified; the code below should run. 

Your job is to make it cleaner and more maintainable.

```{code-cell} ipython3
import os
import numpy as np
import json
from glob import glob 
from pathlib import Path
import numpy as np


path = "data/part-1-data.json"

with open(path, "r") as z:
    x = json.load(z)
    
import pandas as pd
a=pd.json_normalize(x)

b=['publisher', 'DOI', 'type', 'author','is-referenced-by-count', 'title', 'published.date-parts']
df=a.filter(items=b)

for i,r in df.iterrows():
    l = r["published.date-parts"][0]
    df.at[i, 'title'] = df.at[i, 'title'][0]
    s = f"{l[0]}-{l[1]:02d}-{l[2]:02d}"
    d = pd.to_datetime(s, format='%Y-%m-%d')
    df.at[i, 'published_date'] = d

df.drop("published.date-parts", axis=1, inplace=True) 
print(df.shape)

path="data/part-1-datab.json"

with open(path, "r") as z:
    x=json.load(z)

a=pd.json_normalize(x)
b=['publisher', 'DOI', 'type', 'author','is-referenced-by-count', 'title', 'published.date-parts']
df2=a.filter(items=b)

for i, r in df2.iterrows():
    l=r["published.date-parts"][0]
    df2.at[i, 'title'] = df.at[i, 'title'][0]
    s=f"{l[0]}-{l[1]:02d}-{l[2]:02d}"
    d=pd.to_datetime(s, format='%Y-%m-%d')
    df2.at[i, 'published_date']=d

df2.drop("published.date-parts", axis=1, inplace=True) 
df_combined = pd.concat([df, df2], axis=0)
df_combined.shape
```
