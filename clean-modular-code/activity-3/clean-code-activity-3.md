# Activity 3: Tests & Checks for your code

* In [activity 1](../activity-1/clean-code-activity-1), you made your code cleaner and more usable using [expressive variable names](python-expressive) and docstrings to document the module. 
* In [activity 2](../activity-2/clean-code-activity-2), you made your code more DRY ("Don't Repeat Yourself") using documented [functions](write-functions) and [conditionals](python-conditionals). 

In this activity, you will build checks into your workflow using [try/except](try-except) blocks added to functions to handle data processing "features".

+++ {"editable": true, "slideshow": {"slide_type": ""}}

### Real world data processing & workflows and edge cases 

Real-world data rarely can be imported without "work-arounds". You will often find unusual data entries and values you don't expect. Sometimes, these values are documented - for example, a `9999` may represent a missing value in a dataset. Other times, there are typos and other errors in the data that you need to handle. These unusual values or instances in a dataset or workflow are sometimes called "edge cases".  

Writing robust code that handles unexpected values will make your code run smoothly and fail gracefully. This type of code, which combines functions (or classes) and checks within the functions that handle messy data, will make your code easier to maintain.

Things like helpful error messages and fast failing will also improve the experience for someone else using your code--OR your future self. 
 
:::{tip}
Using functions, classes, and methods (functions within a class) is a great first step in handling messy data. A function or method provides a modular unit you can test outside of the workflow for the edge cases you may encounter. Also, because a function is a modular unit, you can add elements to handle unexpected processing features as you build your workflow.

Once you have these functions and methods, you can add checks using conditional statements and [try/except](try-except) blocks that anticipate edge cases and errors that you may encounter when processing your data. 
:::

## Manage the unexpected 

In this activity, you will apply the following strategies to make your code more robust, maintainable & usable:

* **[Fail fast with useful error messages](fail-fast)**: Failing fast is a software engineering term that means allowing your 
  code to stop when something goes wrong, ensuring that errors are caught 
  and communicated promptly. This helps the user quickly understand the error, what went 
  wrong, and where.
* Use **[conditional statements](../checks-conditionals/python-conditionals)** 
  to logically check for specific conditions before executing code. This allows you to create different pathways for code to execute based on specific conditions.
* **[Try/except blocks](../checks-conditionals/python-function-checks)** allow 
  you to handle potential errors by attempting an operation and catching any 
  exceptions if they occur, providing useful feedback. In some cases you may want the program to end on an error. In other cases, you may want to handle it in a specific way. 

Try to use a [Pythonic approach](pythonic-checks) to catch errors early when completing this activity. This means asking for forgiveness later vs. using conditional statements to check an object's state or type.

```{code-cell} ipython3
---
editable: true
slideshow:
  slide_type: ''
---
# This works but is less Pythonic as it's a "look before you leap" approach since it does an extra check before returning the title
def clean_title(title):
    """Notice that this function checks explicitly to see if it's a list and then processes the data.
    """
    if isinstance(title, list):
        return title[0]
    return title
```

The function below raises an error with a custom error message.

```{code-cell} ipython3
---
editable: true
slideshow:
  slide_type: ''
tags: [raises-exception]
---
# This is the preferred way to catch an error 
def clean_title(title):
    """
    Attempts to return the first character of the title.
    Raises the same error with a friendly, custom error message if the input is invalid.
    """
    try:
        return title[0]
    except IndexError as e:
        raise IndexError(f"Oops! You provided a title in an unexpected format. "
                         f"I expected the title to be provided in a list and you provided "
                         f"a {type(title)}.") from e

# Example usage:
title = ""
print(clean_title(title))  # This will raise an IndexError with the friendly message
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
# This is the preferred way to catch an error 
def clean_title(title):
    """
    Attempts to return the first character of the title.

    Raises the same error with a friendly message if the input is invalid.
    """
    try:
        return title[0]
    except IndexError as e:
        raise IndexError(f"Oops! You provided a title in an unexpected format. I expected the title to be provided in a list and you provided a {type(title)}.") 

# Example usage:
title = ""
print(clean_title(title))  # This will raise an IndexError with the friendly message
```

+++ {"editable": true, "slideshow": {"slide_type": ""}}

If you wish, you can shorten the amount of information returned in the error by adding `from None` when you raise the error. This will look nicer to a user, but you lose some detail in the error traceback. 

```{code-cell} ipython3
# This is the preferred way to catch an error 
def clean_title(title):
    """
    Attempts to return the first character of the title.
    Raises the same error with a friendly message if the input is invalid.
    """
    try:
        return title[0]
    except IndexError as e:
        raise IndexError(f"Oops! You provided a title in an unexpected format. "
                         f"I expected the title to be provided in a list and you provided "
                         f"a {type(title)}.") from None 

# Example usage:
title = ""
print(clean_title(title))  # This will raise an IndexError with the friendly message
```

In this activity, you will be working with Pandas dataframes. You may find the `.apply` function to be particularly useful. 

:::{tip}
### Applying functions to DataFrame values: `.apply` 

The `.apply()` function in pandas allows you to apply any function to rows or columns in a `pandas.DataFrame`. For example, you can use it to perform operations on specific column or row values. When you use `.apply()`, you can specify whether you want to apply the function across columns `(axis=0)` (the default) or across rows `(axis=1)`. 

For example, if you want to apply a function to each row of a DataFrame, you would use `df.apply(your_function, axis=1)`. This function is especially useful for applying logic that canâ€™t be easily achieved with built-in pandas functions, allowing for more flexibility in data processing.

You can use `.apply` in pandas to efficiently replace `for loops` to process row and column values in a `pandas.DataFrame`.

### What's changed in your workflow?

:::{warning}
You have a new data file to open in your list of `.json` files in this activity. This file has some unexpected "features" that your code needs to handle gracefully to process all of the data.
:::

The code below is an example of what your code might look like after completing [activity 2](../activity-2/clean-code-activity-2). You can choose to work with this code, or you can use the code that you completed in activity 2. 

Your goal is to make the code below run on the data provided in the activity-3 `data/` directory.

The code below will fail. You will need to do the following:

1. Use a debugger to determine why it's failing.
2. Add try/except blocks and/or conditional statements to your functions that handle various exceptions.

Your end goal is to make the code below run. 

:::{tip}
* If you are using Jupyter, then you might [find this page helpful when setting up debugging.](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/debugger.html)
* VSCODE has a nice visual debugger that you can use.

:::

Important: It is ok if you can't get the code to run fully by the end of this workshop. If you can:

1. identify at least one of the data processing "bugs" (even if you can't fix it) and/or
2. fix at least one bug

You can consider your effort today as a success! We will work on the first element together as a group.

Let's break the code below and see how our code performs. 

* Note that the code below has a modified `/data` directory path (that doesn't exist!).

Questions:
* What type of error do you expect Python to throw? Use Google, LLMs or our [tests and checks](common-exceptions) lesson to help figure this out. 
* Does your code handle this error gracefully?
* How can we make the code handle it better?
