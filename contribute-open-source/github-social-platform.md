# Community Interaction Best Practices on GitHub

## Introduction

GitHub is more than just a platform for hosting code‚Äîit‚Äôs a **social platform** where developers, researchers, and contributors work together to create, improve, and share projects. Behind every username is a person who deserves respect and appreciation.

This lesson will teach you how to interact constructively and positively within the GitHub community. Whether submitting an issue, reviewing someone else‚Äôs work, or asking for help, following these best practices will help you collaborate effectively and maintain a welcoming environment.

## Communication principles and best practices

Effective communication on GitHub ensures a productive and respectful collaboration environment. Whether you're raising an issue, reviewing code, or contributing to a discussion, these principles will help you interact constructively.

### Respect and professionalism

- Treat everyone with respect, even when disagreements arise.
- Remember that many maintainers and contributors volunteer their time and expertise to the community.
- Use polite and appreciative language when reaching out or giving feedback.  
  _Example: "Thank you for creating this tool. It's been really helpful!"_

### Patience

- Be understanding if responses to issues or pull requests take time.
- Open-source maintainers often juggle multiple responsibilities outside their projects.

### Clarity and thoughtfulness

- **Use clear and concise language**:  
  - Clearly describe issues, bugs, or suggestions to avoid confusion.
  - Avoid unnecessary jargon or overcomplicating explanations.
- **Tag people thoughtfully**:  
  - Use `@username` mentions sparingly to notify specific contributors or maintainers.
  - Avoid overusing mentions or tagging unrelated individuals.
- **Use GitHub features wisely**:  
  - Add meaningful comments that contribute to the discussion.
  - Use **reactions** (like üëç or ‚ù§Ô∏è) to express agreement or appreciation without cluttering threads with ‚Äú+1‚Äù comments.

### Constructive feedback

- Avoid harsh language, blame, or criticism.
- Frame suggestions as questions or alternatives:  
  _"What if we try this approach?"_ instead of _"This is wrong."_
- Acknowledge positive aspects alongside suggestions for improvement.

## üîç Social Cues for Contributing to Open Source  

When contributing to an open-source project, it‚Äôs not just about **fixing code**‚Äî  
it‚Äôs also about **collaborating effectively with maintainers and the community**.  
Here are key social cues to follow:  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Help Maintainers Keep Track of Who‚Äôs Working on What  

<i class="fa-solid fa-list-check" style="color: #6ec9c3;"></i> **Open an issue first before submitting a PR.**  

- This prevents duplicate work and ensures the maintainers **know who is working on what**.  
- If an issue already exists, **comment on it** instead of creating a new one.  

<i class="fa-solid fa-triangle-exclamation" style="color: #6ec9c3;"></i> **Avoid surprising maintainers with a PR.**  

- Some projects may not be ready for the change you're suggesting.  
- Opening an issue first allows maintainers to **provide guidance before you start coding**.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Respect the Project‚Äôs Process  

<i class="fa-solid fa-book-open" style="color: #6ec9c3;"></i> **Follow issue templates and contribution guidelines.**  

- Many projects have structured templates‚Äî**use them** to provide all necessary details.  
- If guidelines exist, reference them in your issue to show you're **aligning with their workflow**.  

<i class="fa-solid fa-compass-drafting" style="color: #6ec9c3;"></i> **Ask before making major changes.**  

- If your fix changes functionality, check with maintainers before proceeding.  
- A simple ‚ÄúWould this be useful?‚Äù can save **time for both you and the maintainers**.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Acknowledge the Maintainers‚Äô Time & Role  

<i class="fa-solid fa-handshake-angle" style="color: #6ec9c3;"></i> **Maintain respectful communication.**

- If you're waiting on a response, be patient, and after a reasonable time, you can **politely follow up**.  

<i class="fa-solid fa-user-tag" style="color: #6ec9c3;"></i> **Tag maintainers (when appropriate).**  

- If you know who maintains the repo, consider **@mentioning them** in your issue to establish a connection.  
- Example: `@maintainer-name, I‚Äôd love to help fix this! Any guidance before I start?`

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Communicate Like You Would in Real Life  

<i class="fa-solid fa-comments" style="color: #6ec9c3;"></i> **Be polite and professional.**

- Treat maintainers **as you would a colleague**‚Äîrespectful and appreciative of their time.  

<i class="fa-solid fa-hand-wave" style="color: #6ec9c3;"></i> **Introduce yourself in your first issue comment.**  

- If you‚Äôre new, a friendly introduction can make it easier to build relationships.  
- Example:  
  > ‚ÄúHey everyone! üëã I‚Äôm new to contributing here and would love to help with this issue. Let me know if there‚Äôs anything I should consider before getting started!‚Äù

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Build Trust Through Small Contributions  

<i class="fa-solid fa-user-check" style="color: #6ec9c3;"></i> **Start small to establish credibility.**  

- First contributions aren‚Äôt just about code‚Äîthey're about **building trust with the community**.  
- **Small fixes** (like documentation updates or typo corrections) are a great way to get started.  

<i class="fa-solid fa-layer-group" style="color: #6ec9c3;"></i> **Contributions add up over time.**  

- Even small changes **help the project grow** and demonstrate your commitment.  
- Once maintainers recognize your contributions, they‚Äôre more likely to engage with your work.
