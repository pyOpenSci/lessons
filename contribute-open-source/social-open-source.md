# The social side of open source: Engage, build trust & support contributors  

## Why social etiquette matters in open source  

Contributing to open source isn‚Äôt just about code‚Äîit‚Äôs about **collaborating with people you may never meet in real life**. Unlike traditional workplaces, GitHub interactions happen asynchronously, across time zones, and often with volunteers.  

This means **how you communicate is just as important as what you contribute**.  

This lesson covers three key aspects of open source etiquette:  

**1Ô∏è‚É£ Engage thoughtfully in open source communities**  
Learn how to interact professionally in issues, PRs, and discussions to make collaboration smooth and efficient.  

**2Ô∏è‚É£ Build trust through transparent collaboration**  
Trust helps your contributions get reviewed and merged faster. You‚Äôll learn how to show maintainers you‚Äôre a reliable contributor.  

**3Ô∏è‚É£ Don't bite off more than you can chew**


:::{admonition} For maintainers
:class: tip
**Support contributors to feel confident and welcome**  
Many new contributors struggle with GitHub‚Äôs learning curve and imposter syndrome. If you have bandwidth, try to be sensitive to that. If you don't have bandwidth, gently nudge them to a project that might be a better fit for them if you don't.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Engage thoughtfully in open source communities  

Since most GitHub collaboration is asynchronous, effective communication ensures your contributions are received well and help move projects forward.  

### <i class="fa-solid fa-list-check"></i> Keep maintainers informed  

- **Open an issue before submitting a pull request (PR).**  
  - Maintainers **need to track who is working on what**.  
  - If an issue already exists, **comment instead of opening a new one**.  

- **Avoid surprising maintainers with an unexpected PR.**  
  - Some projects **may not be ready** for your change.  
  - Opening an issue first allows maintainers to **guide your work before you start coding**.  

---

### <i class="fa-solid fa-book-open"></i> Respect the project‚Äôs workflow  

- **Follow contribution guidelines.**  
  - Many projects have structured templates for submitting issues‚Äî**use them** to provide the right details.  
  - If a project has contribution guidelines, reference them to show you‚Äôre **aligning with their process**.  

- **Ask before making major changes.**  
  - A simple *‚ÄúWould this be useful?‚Äù* in an issue can save **time for both you and the maintainers**.  

---

### <i class="fa-solid fa-handshake-angle"></i> Communicate professionally  

- **Be patient and respectful.**  
  - Many maintainers **volunteer their time**‚Äîmake your requests **clear and easy to understand**.  
  - If you're waiting on a response, give it time before **politely following up**.  

- **Be concise and avoid unnecessary comments.**  
  - We live in an age of too many notifications. Keep your responses short, polite and to the point. 
  - If it's appropriate, instead of commenting **‚Äú+1‚Äù** or ‚ÄúI agree,‚Äù use üëç or ‚ù§Ô∏è to acknowledge messages.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Start Small and Contribute Sustainably

Contributing should not be overwhelming and should be sustainable. Starting with small contributions will help you build confidence and credibility while keeping contributions manageable

### <i class="fa-solid fa-user-check" style="color: #81c0aa;"></i> Making contributing less intimidating  

- **Start small to build confidence.**  
  - First contributions don‚Äôt have to be big‚Äî**fixing typos or improving docs** is a great start. Just make sure that the project that you're contributing to welcomes these types of contributions before starting one!  
  - These small changes **help the project** and **show maintainers that you‚Äôre engaged**.  

- **Contributions add up over time.**  
  - Even small contributions build credibility‚Äîonce maintainers recognize you, they will likely review your work faster.
  - 

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Build trust through transparent collaboration  

Trust is the foundation of all collaboration‚Äîespecially in open source, where maintainers may not know you yet. Since your **first impression happens through issues, PRs, and comments**, it‚Äôs important to show that you‚Äôre **thoughtful, respectful, and mindful of the maintainers‚Äô time**.  

### <i class="fa-solid fa-user-plus"></i> How contributors can build trust  

- **Introduce yourself when commenting on an issue.**  
  - A quick hello makes it easier to start contributing.  
  - Example:  
    > ‚ÄúHey everyone! üëã Thank you for your work on this project. I‚Äôm new to contributing here and would love to help with this issue. Let me know if there‚Äôs anything I should consider before getting started!‚Äù  

- **Be transparent about what you‚Äôre working on.**  
  - If you start working on an issue, leave a comment so others know.  
  - Example:  
    > ‚ÄúI‚Äôd love to take this on! I‚Äôll start by updating the docs and submit a PR soon.‚Äù  

- **Follow the project‚Äôs workflow and be responsive.**  
  - Maintain good communication‚Äîif a maintainer asks for changes, reply and iterate.  
  - If you can‚Äôt finish something, let them know so someone else can pick it up.

## For maintainers: Support contributors to feel confident and welcome  

Many contributors hesitate to get involved due to **imposter syndrome or fear of making mistakes**.  
Maintainers and experienced contributors can help by making GitHub feel more accessible.  

If you don‚Äôt have the bandwidth to support a new contributor, acknowledge their effort and, if possible, point them to alternative resources or other beginner-friendly projects.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-users"></i> How maintainers can support contributors  

- **Be welcoming to new contributors.**  
  - A simple ‚ÄúThanks for your interest!‚Äù or ‚ÄúHappy to have you here!‚Äù makes a big difference.  
  - Example:  
    > ‚ÄúWelcome! üöÄ This is a great first issue to start with‚Äîlet us know if you need any help.‚Äù  

- **Acknowledge contributions‚Äîeven small ones.**  
  - A ‚ÄúThank you!‚Äù comment or merging a small PR quickly builds confidence.  

- **Provide clear, actionable feedback.**  
  - If a PR needs changes, explain **why** so contributors learn and improve.  
  - Example:  
    > ‚ÄúThis is a great start! Could you also update the docs so future users understand this change?‚Äù

- **Use supportive language in issues and PRs.**  
  - Instead of "This is wrong," try "Let's adjust this to match the project style." 

## Summary: The social side of open source  

Open source is truly more than just about code. It's about building trust and relationships and, for new contributors, great opportunities to learn and build social, technical, and even management skills. 
Following these best practices will set yourself up for great success when navigating the open source community. And in the process, you may even pick up some lifelong friends along the way!
