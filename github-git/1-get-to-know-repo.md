# Get to Know a (new to you) GitHub Repository

:::{admonition} What you will learn:

In this tutorial, you will get to know a GitHub repo that you want to contribute to. You will learn how to find the CONTRIBUTING.md file in our [example GitHub repo](https://github.com/pyOpenSci/pyos-demo-package-contribute) and identify the process for submitting a contribution to the repo. 
:::


(contributing)=
## Get started

To begin, get to know the repository that you want to contribute:

* **Check out the README file**: Check out the [**README.md** file](https://github.com/pyOpenSci/pyos-demo-package-contribute/blob/main/README.md) to learn more about the project, how it's used and often, it will guide you to the project's contributing and development guides for making contributing if they exist.  
* **Read the contributing guide**: The [**CONTRIBUTING.md** file](https://github.com/pyOpenSci/pyos-demo-package-contribute/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) that tells you more about the types of contributions this project accepts and the workflows it embraces.

The sidebar highlights metadata, such as the repository description, links, and license details. The README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md files are highlighted."

Above is a screenshot of the pyOpensci practice repo that you will use. Notice the CONTRIBUTING.md file. You should read this file after checking out the README file.

## Documentation counts! 

Many people's first contributions are to documentation! Documentation contributions can be incredibly valuable as developers often don't have time to work on documentation and code!

Fixing typos and other small documentation issues makes for great, easy-to-create (and review) first pull requests. In fact, if you find that the contributing information isn't detailed enough, that could also be your first contribution!

When you edit documentation, you can often make the changes in the GitHub interface online versus needing to clone the repository and work locally.


:::{admonition} A real-life first contribution to PyPI

[Here is an example issue that resulted in 2 small pull requests to PyPI (warehouse)](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/issues/17374). In this case, the images were outdated, so it was a bug in the documentation that needed to be fixed. However, while getting to know the repository, the author also found issues with the development documentation, so they submitted a pull request to address that as well. Both pull requests were small.
