# How to Fork a GitHub Repository 

ðŸš§ These lessons are under heavy construction and will continue to change through March 2025 ðŸš§ 

:::{admonition} What you will learn:

In this lesson, you will learn how to <kbd>fork</kbd> (or create a copy of) a GitHub repo into your own **GitHub.com** account. You can practice forking the pyOpenSci example repository.

When you fork a GitHub repository, you make a copy of the files and the commit history into your personal account. This allows you to work on the files on your own before suggesting changes through a pull request to make to the parent repository that you forked from.

## Who owns a GitHub repository?

When a repository is stored on **GitHub.com**, it is assigned a unique URL (i.e. link on the **GitHub.com** website) that can be used to find the repository and access its files. While repositories on **GitHub.com** can be made either public or private, the default is public for free **GitHub** accounts.

In either case (public or private), the URL links to a **GitHub** repository always follows the same format: 

`https://github.com/username/repository-name`

The username is the username owner of the repo owner. The username can either be an individual such as `lwasser` (your **GitHub** username), or it can represent an organization such as `pyOpenSci`.

For example, the repository that you will work within this lesson is owned by `pyopensci.` Therefore, the URL looks like this:

`https://github.com/pyopensci/repo-name`

## Fork a GitHub repository

Using **GitHub.com**, you can create a copy of another user's or organizationâ€™s repositoryâ€”a process called `forking`. When you fork a repository, you get your own version to work on. And you can do that wrok without affecting the original files in the parent repository. Others can also fork your repositories, creating their own copies.

Forking is useful because the fork remains linked to the original repository. This allows you to:
- Update your fork with changes from the original repository.
- Suggest changes to the original repository, which the owner can review and accept.

By forking, everyone collaborates on their own copies of the project, ensuring the original files stay intact. All changes are tracked in the file history and can be undone if needed. You can fork a repository directly from its main page on **GitHub.com**.

To fork a repo:

1. Navigate to the repo page that you wish to fork - example:

`https://github.com/pyopensci/repo-name`

2. On that page, you will see a button in the UPPER RIGHT hand corner that says `Fork`. The number next to that button tells you how many times the repo has already been forked. 
3. Click on the `Fork` button and select your user account when it asks you where you want to fork the repo. 
4. Once you have forked the repo, you will have a copy in your account. Navigate to your repo page. The URL should look something like this:

`https://github.com/your-user-name/repo-name`

To fork a repo, first, navigate to the repo you want to fork. Then click the **fork** button in the upper right-hand corner of your screen. You can then create a copy of this repo in your account.

## Activity: Fork a repository and modify a file

### 1. Fork the pyOpenSci practice GitHub repository

Fork the <a href="http://www.github.com/pyopensci/repo-here" target="_blank">pyOpenSci demo repository on GitHub</a>. Remember that a fork is a copy of a repository that is owned by someone else or an organization that lives in your GitHub account.

:::{tip}
A repository fork is a copy of the GitHub repository that you own in your GitHub account. The repository, however, is still connected to the main repository on GitHub that you forked. This connection means that you can submit pull requests and changes to the repository using your fork. 
:::

Once you have submitted your issue with the proposed changes, one of the package developers will review the issue and either:

* Suggest changes to your proposed edits or
* Encourage you to submit a pull request with the two identified changes.

When you have the go-ahead from someone who owns the repository, you are ready to create and submit a pull request with your changes.

:::{tip}
If you have already forked the repository but some time has passed. You should consider updating or syncing your fork. GitHub has a sync button that you can use to do this (`pyopensci/repo-name`). This will ensure that all of the files in your repository are current and will prevent merge conflicts.
