# Your first edits to a file in your fork 

In this lesson, you will edit a documentation file (or a docstring) using the GitHub interface. You do not need to [clone or make a copy of your repo locally](clone-repo) to do this! This is a great way to make your first contribution to open source without using the command line! 

## Make the changes that you said you would make in the issue opened above 

After you have forked the repo and received the OK to move forward with your pull request:

* Open the file you want to change in your fork.
* Make the edits that you want to make to the file
* Commit the changes that you made to the file. Important: try to use a short descriptive commit message that describes what you have changed:
*
> fix: fixed numerous typos in the filename.py file
> fix: updated the code to align with PEP 8 syntax
> fix: fixed typo in docstring text 

::::{admonition} What is a commit??

A **commit** is a feature in the [git version control](what-is-git) that is similar to saving your changes with a note explaining what you did.

It might be cool to show first contributions like my first on to nbconvert could be interesting? Other people might have examples too
