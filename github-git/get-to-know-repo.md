# Get to Know a (new to you) GitHub Repository

:::{admonition} What you will learn:
:class: tip

In this tutorial, you will get to know a GitHub repo that you want to contribute to. You will learn how to find the CONTRIBUTING.md file in our [example GitHub repo](https://github.com/pyOpenSci/pyos-demo-package-contribute) and identify the process for submitting a contribution to the repo.
:::

## How to get to know a GitHub repo  

Before contributing, it's important to **familiarize yourself with the repository** to ensure your contribution aligns with the project's needs. Doing this **saves time** for both you and the maintainers, making the process smoother.  

### 1. Check the README and CONTRIBUTING guide  

The **README** provides an overview of the project, its purpose, and how it is used. Often, it also links to the project's contributing and development guides.  
- **Review the README file**: The [**README.md** file](https://github.com/pyOpenSci/pyos-demo-package-contribute/blob/main/README.md) will help you understand the project's goals.  
- **Read the CONTRIBUTING guide**: The [**CONTRIBUTING.md** file](https://github.com/pyOpenSci/pyos-demo-package-contribute/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) explains what types of contributions are accepted and the expected workflow.  

**<i class="fa-solid fa-handshake-angle" style="color: #81c0aa;"></i> Social cue:** If these files clearly **welcome contributions** and outline next steps, itâ€™s a good sign that the maintainers are open to contributions.

### 2. Look at project activity and maintainer responsiveness  

- Scan the **issues and pull requests** sections on GitHub to see how long it generally takes for maintainers to respond.  
- Check the **date of the latest commit** to determine whether the project is actively maintained.  
- Look for **"good first issue"** or **"help wanted"** labels in the issues. These labels suggest that the maintainer team welcomes contributions and might be more beginner-friendly.  

**<i class="fa-regular fa-clock" style="color: #81c0aa;"></i> Social cue:** If maintainers **regularly respond** and merge contributions, your work is more likely to be reviewed and accepted in a timely manner as well.

### 3. Understand the projectâ€™s infrastructure  

Some repositories have specific **code and text format and workflow requirements**. Make sure to check if the project uses:  
- **Code formatters and linters**: Does the project use [code formatters or linters](https://www.pyopensci.org/python-package-guide/package-structure-code/code-style-linting-format.html#python-package-code-style-format-and-linters)?  
- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Are there automated tests and checks that run when a new PR is submitted?  
- **Licensing**: The [projectâ€™s license](https://www.pyopensci.org/python-package-guide/documentation/repository-files/license-files.html) dictates how you can use, modify, and distribute the code.  
  - The **MIT and BSD-3 licenses** permit broad use with attribution; these licenses are common in the scientific open source ecosystem.  
  - A **GPL license** requires derivative works to follow the same open source terms.  This is what's known as a [copy-left license](https://www.pyopensci.org/python-package-guide/documentation/repository-files/license-files.html#use-open-permissive-licenses-when-possible). 

**<i class="fa-solid fa-circle-check" style="color: #81c0aa;"></i> Social cue:** If the project follows **consistent coding standards and has CI in place**, it likely has an **organized review process**, that is setup to accept contributions. Further, if the project uses tools such as the [pre-commit ci bot](https://www.pyopensci.org/python-package-guide/package-structure-code/code-style-linting-format.html#pre-commit-ci), code formatting and linting might be possible on GitHub within the pull request it self using CI. This means you won't need to setup a development environment to "clean up" any changes that you make in a PR.  

### 4. Check for a Code of Conduct  

A **Code of Conduct** helps ensure a **welcoming and respectful** community.  
- If one exists, read it to understand community expectations.  
- If missing, check discussions in issues and pull requests to gauge how maintainers interact with contributors.  

**<i class="fa-solid fa-scale-balanced" style="color: #81c0aa;"></i> Social cue:** A clear code of conduct signals an **inclusive and structured** community. If discussions show **helpful, constructive feedback**, it's a good sign of a positive project culture.

### 5. See if contributors are acknowledged  

- Do maintainers **thank contributors** in merged PRs or reference them in the README?  
- Is there a **CONTRIBUTORS file** or an **all-contributors bot** recognizing contributions?  

**<i class="fa-solid fa-users" style="color: #81c0aa;"></i> Social cue:** If past contributors are **acknowledged and appreciated**, it suggests a community that values participation.

The above steps will help you determine whether a project is **welcoming, responsive, and well-maintained**, making it a great place to contribute! ðŸš€


## Next steps
Once you have explored and gotten to know the repository and decided that it's a good project to contribute to, it's time to [find an issue to work](identify-issue). You will learn more about that next.
