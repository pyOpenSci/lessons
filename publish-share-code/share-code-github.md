# Share your code on GitHub 

Sharing your code on GitHub or another online version control platform, such as GitLab, is a great way to make your work available for others to see, use, and collaborate on. 

Making your code openly available online promotes collaboration and transparency in support of open science. 

GitHub and GitLab are also powerful collaboration tools. These platforms allow you to make your code open, and have tools that enable others to see your code, review changes, suggest changes, and open issues around broken or desired features. 

Hosting code on GitHub helps you manage your projects, track changes, and keep your work organized over time. 

## Cite your code  

Even if you haven't published your code in an academic Journal, you can create a DOI that allows you to cite it using [Zenodo](zenodo). While you can upload code and other types of documents to Zenodo at any time, if you are using GitHub, you can create a direct connection, which will not only provide a DOI for the GitHub repository but also allow you to create new sub-DOIs for every new version of your code that you make.

This is now commented out because it requires more git skills than I want to teach in our workshop. 

## How to get started

There are several ways to place your code on GitHub. Here, we will show you a quick and dirty way to move your code to GitHub! The steps are

1. Make sure that you have a GitHub account
1. Create a repository on GitHub.com  
2. Clone that repository
3. Once you have a clone, locally, create a new branch in the clone.
4. Copy your code over to the branch
5. Add & commit your code to the branch.
6. Push the code to GitHub!
And you're done!



TODO: add 5-7 min video on how this works

Another way is to create a repository locally

[Software Carpentry teaches you how to do this locally](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/03-create.html) but initializing a local. Directory and then pushing it to GitHub
